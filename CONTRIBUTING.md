# Contribution Guidelines

* Use the following format: `[library](link) - Description. [LICENSE]`
* The link should be the name of the package or project.
* Add one link per pull-request.
* Keep descriptions concise, clear and simple, and end them with a period / stop.
* If there is no license use the `[NO LICENSE]` tag.
* If the license is unknown to you just link to it directly with the `[LICENSE]` tag (for example see another project).
* Add new licenses (such that no other project uses) to the bottom of the page for easy referencing.
* New categories, or improvements to the existing ones are also welcome.
* Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
* It is desirable for the whole thing to fit on one line after getting rendered by GitHub.
* The mentioning of 'Make' in the description should have the first letter as capital.

## Quality standard

To stay on the list, projects should follow these quality standards:

* Generally used and useful to the community.
* Actively maintained (even if that just means take care of open issues).
* Atleast partially documented.

Thanks to all [contributors](https://github.com/sgimeno/awesome-make/graphs/contributors), you're awesome and this list wouldn't be possible without you!
